# Dynamic Webserver
This webserver can be started on port :4000 to serve content for all 
projects. It should be used by the html previewer with the src attribute
of the iframe like src="http://localhost:4000/<project name>/out/file.html"

## Intention
The agent can build simple web applications which can modify data using REST API endpoints 

Find an example in example_api_endpoint.py

## Result
By using this delivery method the agent can write React components which actually are able to modify content
