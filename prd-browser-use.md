# Browser Use

I want to use the Vercel agent-browser npm package (https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) together with the skill in our backend project.

# Installation & Our Process-Manager in the backend

My main concern is the installation and the integration with our process manager. In the service console i want to see whether agent-browser is installed and/or running.

## Create Skill

Copy the skill along with all the included files and direcotry as a standard skill "browser-use" into our skill directory https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser/tree/main/skills/agent-browser

## Update Docker file

We must install the package with npm -g

## Update the README.md 

In the # The Web: Searching, Scraping and Browsing section add some information about the package installation
