# Scrapbook — Quick Start

Welcome! The Scrapbook is your project's interactive notebook. Think of it as a structured place to capture ideas, requirements, decisions, and notes — organized as a visual mindmap that you can explore, prioritize, and update over time.

## Getting started

There are two ways to get going:

### Option 1: Start from the dashboard

Open the **Scrapbook** view from your project dashboard. You'll see two tabs:

- **Graph view** — a visual mindmap where you can drag, expand, and explore your notes
- **Table view** — a spreadsheet-like list of all items with sortable columns

If you already have notes or ideas written down somewhere, click the menu (three dots) and choose **Create from Text**. Paste in your content — meeting notes, a brainstorm, a requirements list, anything — and the system will automatically organize it into a structured mindmap.

### Option 2: Start from the chat

Just tell the assistant you want to use the scrapbook. Something like:

> *"Let's start a scrapbook for my project"*
> *"Add this to my notes: we need to finalize the budget by Friday"*
> *"What have we captured so far?"*

The assistant will read your scrapbook automatically and help you add, review, and organize items through conversation.

## How the scrapbook is organized

Everything in the scrapbook lives in a tree, like a folder structure:

- **Project Theme** — the big-picture topic (one per scrapbook)
  - **Categories** — major areas (e.g., "Design", "Budget", "Timeline")
    - **Subcategories** — groupings within an area
      - **Concepts** — individual ideas or items
        - **Attributes** — details and properties

You don't need to worry about these labels — the system figures out the right level automatically when you add something. Just say where you want it to go and it'll be placed correctly.

## Priorities and focus

Every item has two settings that help you stay organized:

### Priority (1 to 10) — How important is this?

- **9–10**: Critical, must-have
- **7–8**: Important, should address soon
- **5–6**: Normal, nice-to-have
- **3–4**: Can wait
- **1–2**: Just for reference

### Focus — How much attention does this need right now?

- **High**: Actively working on it
- **Medium**: On your radar
- **Low**: Parked for now
- **Minimal**: Stored for reference

You can set these in the table view, or just tell the assistant in plain language:

> *"Make the budget item top priority"*
> *"I'm focusing on the design phase right now"*
> *"Park the timeline for now"*

**Tip**: An item can be high-priority but low-focus (important but not started yet), or low-priority but high-focus (small task you're doing right now). This lets you separate *what matters* from *what you're working on today*.

---

## Asking for a focus review

When you want to know what matters most, just ask:

> *"What should I focus on?"*
> *"Show me the high-priority items"*
> *"What's most important right now?"*

The assistant will pull up everything that's marked as both important and needing attention, sorted by priority.

## Tips

- **Capture everything** — even small notes. You can always adjust priorities later.
- **Use the graph view** to see the big picture and how ideas connect.
- **Use the table view** to quickly scan, sort, and edit many items at once.
- **Review regularly** — ask the assistant to show you your focus items and update what's changed.
- **Multiple scrapbooks** — you can create more than one scrapbook per project if you need separate notebooks for different topics.

## Your scrapbook is always saved

Everything you add is stored automatically. You can close the chat, come back later, and pick up right where you left off. The assistant reads your scrapbook at the start of each conversation so it always knows what's there.

Happy note-taking!
