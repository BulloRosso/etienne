# Brainstorming — Quick Start

Welcome! This skill turns  into your personal brainstorming partner. You talk through ideas, Etienne helps structure them into diagrams — and everything gets saved automatically so you can pick up right where you left off.

---

## Getting started

Just tell Etienne you want to brainstorm. Something like:

> *"Let's brainstorm my new product idea"*
> *"I'd like to collect ideas for our onboarding flow"*
> *"Can we map out the checkout process?"*

Etienne will ask a couple of quick questions and then get things going.

---

## What happens next

Etienne will create a diagram based on what you describe. Depending on your topic, it might suggest a **mindmap** (great for open exploration), a **flowchart** (good for processes and decisions), or a **sequence diagram** (ideal when there are multiple actors involved). You can always ask to switch.

To help spark new ideas, Etienne will also offer up to three suggestions pulled from a quick web search — you can add any of them to your diagram, or just ignore them and keep going your own way.

## Building out your diagram

Just keep the conversation going. Say things like:

> *"Add a branch for pricing"*
> *"Remove the third step"*
> *"What if we split this into two paths?"*

Etienne will update the diagram, show you the result, and keep a running index of your ideas in a file called `ideation/ideas.md`.

---

## Your files, always safe

Before Etienne makes any change, it automatically saves a backup. You'll always see which version was just created. If you don't like a change, just say:

> *"Undo that"* or *"Go back to the previous version"*

Etienne will restore it instantly. You can also jump back to any earlier version if you need to.

---

## Working on multiple diagrams

You can have several diagrams on the go — one for product ideas, another for a user journey, and so on. Just tell Etienne which one you want to work on and it will switch over. The current diagram is always shown at the top of Etienne's response so you always know where you are.

---

## Wrapping up

When you're done, just say so. Etienne will tidy up the index and give you a quick summary of what was created. Everything is saved in the `ideation/` folder in your project, ready for next time.

Happy brainstorming! 🌱
